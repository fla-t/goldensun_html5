# Golden Sun Engine - HTML5
An online **Golden Sun Engine** built in HTML5 with [PhaserJS CE 2.15.0](http://phaser.io/).

**See the [DEMO](https://jjppof.github.io/goldensun_html5/index).**

- Feel free to help! Please, reach me if you want to do so.
- If you found any bug, please create an issue for it.
- I'm avoiding making some docs for now because I'm constantly changing things. But see the [wiki](https://github.com/jjppof/goldensun_html5/wiki).
- I use [projects](https://github.com/jjppof/goldensun_html5/projects/1) to write down things.

## Development environment

GSHTML5 has no external dependency, so there's no `npm install` or packages on CDN, etc. It's a standalone. Just clone the project and run it into a http server. I would recommend these steps:
- Clone the project (or download it and extract the files);
- Download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install it (make sure you add node.js in the system path);
- In the terminal, install a light http server using `npm install http-server -g`;
- In the terminal, go to the root folder of the GSHTML5 you cloned and then run `http-server`;
- Go to your browser and access the address shown in the terminal (it's probably `http://localhost:8080/`).
- I strongly reccomend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to develop.
